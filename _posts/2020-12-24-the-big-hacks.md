This is my own record and somewhat informed perspective of significant software hacks within the software development history during my lifetime, and how they shaped the industry.

## Heartbleed
https://heartbleed.com/
(CVE-2014-0160)

### What was Heartbleed?

Problem: Improper pointer arithmetic resulting in out-of-bounds memory reads

Severity: Memory exposure and private key recovery

Worst case scenario: An attacker can perform out-of-bounds reads of values from a processâ€™s memory. Sophisticated attacks allowed for the recovery of SSL/TLS private keys or other sensitive data in-memory.

**The takeaway**: too easy to make naive rookie mistakes in c open-source software that is fundamental to all cryptography

## Specter
https://spectreattack.com/
(CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715)

### What was Specter?

Problem: Abuse of i86 speculative code execution allowed for leaky application boundaries

Severity: Memory exposure and private key recovery

Worst case scenario: An attacker with knowledge of processor hardware and vulnerable code could design efficient malware.

**The takeaway**: this bug is endemic to current intel hardware going back 15 years. Software patches could disable speculative execution at the cost of significant performance decreases. This bug is a big distraction to Intel, and must be navigated around for future chip designs.
