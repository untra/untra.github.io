<p>There is no right way to build software, but plenty of wrong ways. This presentation identifies a common theme among software bugs, and gives developers of all stripes an intuition on how to recognize and avoid software defects in the first place, and prevent larger bugs from threatening the organization. By considering notions of state management in software, we hope developers can recognize when the code they write is fragile and bug-prone when MUTATING state, SHARING state, and working with UNSTRUCTURED state. The presentation concludes with a conclusion of the emergent complications of what happens when the advice is not heeded, and an industry vision of where software development is headed- with better tools, and fewer bugs.</p>
