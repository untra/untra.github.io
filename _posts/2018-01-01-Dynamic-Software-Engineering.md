# Dynamic Software Engineering Methodology

When I was in college I wrote code like a cowboy. Now I write code like an astronaut.

there is a range between "getting it out the door" and "get it done right".

Fundamentally there are three limiting factors to all of software engineering: time, money and entropy.

**TIME:** there is only so much time between now and in three iterations when you ship. What features, tasks, bug fixes are you looking to get shipped? as a manager you can pump your employees full of caffeine and treats but ultimately they need to piece together parts of a backlog, sewing together systems and piping out processes.

**MONEY:** the company runs entirely on the money being generated through the sales and use of your software. Unbeknownst to some engineers is the slow _drip drip drip_ of the fiscal fuel that powers this whole enterprise. The less of a drag you are on the rocket ship - startup - ride, the more valuable you are to the company.

**ENTROPY:** this is randomness, risk the _unforseen_. We live in a world set in motion, amidst fortune good and bad and entirely neutral. new tooling may assist helping you on your quest to supply your customers, but the same tooling can help your competitors.

These three forces are not static to the development process; your business and engineering effort can influence these forces. Time, Money and Entropy are impressionable by decisons made by the company. _How quickly do we get to market?_ _Do we invest in long-term engineering forces, or mercenaries?_ _Should we take the time to ensure product security, or do we risk product stability with a fix?_

Its all about prioritizing these three factors into your startup. Your business may be in a position to tolerate each of these factors differently. Hell, these principles apply to humans as well, if you _squint a little_.

Okay, so these seem like mostly business concerns, so what can an organization do to promote

## Reccomended new project sprint structure

Dedicate _at least three iterations_ to initial project research and organization, continous integration and delivery and automation deployment, and dependency rangling and management. This is time for getting the software team together and on the same page, and thinking about long term architectual decisions.

This is also the time for the team to lay a foundation of friendship, trust, excitement and intrigue. This is research and development at its core. There is no harm in taking too long in this process, only in taking too little. Project stability, automation and supply stocking will enable a team to focus on the actually engineering process, especially as the project continues.

# Convention over Configuration over Code

Convention over Configuration was one of those phrases a couple of

make some reasonable choices about what the software will do. Don't make everything possible, just the essentials. Thats convention.

Make things easily changeable by defining as many constants and levers as can be defined through configurations. This should be JSON, YAML or some other developer or user friendly interface. Done properly this enables the O of the SOLID principle ; your code quickly becomes open for extension and closed for modification.
