# Designing a self-everything factory

* Self-Building: expanding rail network (DONE)
* Self-Sustaining: extracts resources and connects fluids (Needs fix)
* Self-Planning: aware of deficiencies in supply, and building to demand
* Self-Defending: capable of fighting back against the locals
* Self-Researching: aware of what to research and where to expand science demand
* Self-Upgrading: capable of upgrading and repairing existing factory
* Self-Winning: factory proceeds to reach victory conditions alongside production demands
* Self-Contained: final solution is simple for anyone to understand and deploy

_all of this in parallel and uncoordinated manner_

## Preface; what is factorio?

## What are recursive blueprints?
