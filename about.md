## 💎 Samuel Volin
Programmer, Mathematician, Rad Dude & Your Friend

#### Hello! I am **Samuel Volin** aka _UNTRA_
<sam@untra.io> - [_keybase_](https://keybase.io/untra) - [_github_](https://github.com/untra) - [_twitter_](https://twitter.com/untra) - [_linkedin_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/untra/) - [_eth address_](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0570b8f2ee4dc8b710bf0c18269b3902857cfdca)

## 🏁 Mission Statement

Programming is more than a skill, it is a craft.

Good software is not conceived, it is developed over time, preferably by a team of dedicated and passionate friends, and with an eye towards overarching design and flexibility. Software engineering is about studying the trade-offs and nuances of the tools at your disposal, and becoming fearless in the face of the technical unknown. Through gradual practice and research, mastery is attainable.

## 🌄 Currently

I am a professional Software Developer, currently residing in **Denver, Colorado**. I am passionate about mathematics, functional programming, software engineering, polyglot programming, network security, cryptography, and developer operations.

I was previously employed at [_LogRhythm_](https://logrhythm.com/) 💠

I have navigated fulfillment of FIPS 140-2 requirements for a project. I have broken monoliths into microservices. I have shoveled legacy code into tested & automated nightly builds and all of it again in <button dark-toggle aria-hidden>Night mode</button>. My tenure at LogRhythm taught me the importance of customer collaboration, automation of operations, and open technical perspectives. Those experiences taught me to recognize simple solutions and how to mentally begin to address chicken and egg problems.

I am currently employed at [_StackHawk_](https://stackhawk.com) 🦅

Wrote terraform to provision replicated codebuild jobs across striped environments, expanded upon and helped structure the initial UI, slack, jira, datadog integrations, began to harness the _the sacred power of the kubectl..._

## 🤹 Technical Skills

I currently enjoy working with [_Typescript_](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [_Kotlin_](https://kotlinlang.org/). Previously I worked significantly with [_Go_](https://golang.org/) and [_Elixir_](https://elixir-lang.org/) . I also have familiarity and experience working in _Java_, _C_ and _Ruby_ .

I like my frontends in react, angular, vue-js... just as long as its typescript.
I like my backends in kotlin spring boot, or generated from openapi files.
I like my notification services stateless
I like my operations managed with k8s and monitored with grafana

I prefer [_Terraform_](https://terraform.io) to provision replicated environments with IAC

## Tools of the Trade

[vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) [better touch tool](https://folivora.ai/) [lens](https://k8slens.dev/) [docker](https://www.docker.com/) [slack](https://slack.com/) [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/) [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) [zap](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/) [stackhawk](https://www.stackhawk.com/) [grafana](https://grafana.com/)

### Philosophies

I am familiar with both the _Object Oriented Programming_ and _Functional Programming_
 software design philosophies. I have strong opinions about both of these, ask me about them.

I also adhere loosely to the design philosophy of _Railway Oriented Programming_ and _Test Driven Development_.

I enjoy working with the _Scrum_ and _Kanban_ iterative development philosophies.

> There is no one right way to build software.
