## About Samuel Volin
Hello! I am **Samuel Volin**
@untra üíé [_keybase_](https://keybase.io/untra) - [_github_](https://github.com/untra) - [_twitter_](https://twitter.com/untra) - [_eth address_](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0570b8f2ee4dc8b710bf0c18269b3902857cfdca)

Programming is more than a skill, it is a craft.

Good software is not conceived, it is developed over time, preferably by a team of dedicated and passionate friends, and with an eye towards overarching design and flexibility. Software engineering is about studying the trade-offs and nuances of the tools at your disposal, and becoming fearless in the face of the technical unknown. Through gradual practice and research, mastery is attainable.

I am a professional Software Developer, currently residing in **Boulder, Colorado**. I am passionate about mathematics, functional programming, software engineering, polyglot programming and developer operations. I have navigated fulfillment of FIPS 140-2 requirements for a project. I have broken monoliths into microservices. I have unscrambled impossible bugs while not simultaneously seducing a woman. I have shoveled legacy code into tested & automated nightly builds and all of it again in _night mode_.
