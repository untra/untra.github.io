## Samuel Volin
Programmer, Mathematician, Rad Dude & Your Friend

Hello! I am **Samuel Volin**

## Mission Statement

Programming is more than a skill, it is a craft.

Good software is not conceived, it is developed over time, preferably by a team of dedicated and passionate friends, and with an eye towards overarching design and flexibility. Software engineering is about studying the trade-offs and nuances of the tools at your disposal, and becoming fearless in the face of the technical unknown. Through gradual practice and research, mastery is attainable.
