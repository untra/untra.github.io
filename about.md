## 💎 Samuel Volin
Programmer, Mathematician, Rad Dude & Your Friend

#### Hello! I am **Samuel Volin** aka _UNTRA_
<sam@untra.io> - [_keybase_](https://keybase.io/untra) - [_github_](https://github.com/untra) - [_twitter_](https://twitter.com/untra) - [_linkedin_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/untra/) - [_eth address_](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0570b8f2ee4dc8b710bf0c18269b3902857cfdca)

## 🏁 Mission Statement

Programming is more than a skill, it is a craft.

Good software is not conceived, it is developed over time, preferably by a team of dedicated and passionate friends, and with an eye towards overarching design and flexibility. Software engineering is about studying the trade-offs and nuances of the tools at your disposal, and becoming fearless in the face of the technical unknown. Through gradual practice and research, mastery is attainable.

## 🌄 Currently

I am a professional Software Developer, currently residing in **Denver, Colorado**. I am passionate about mathematics, functional programming, software engineering, polyglot programming, network security, cryptography, and developer operations.

I was previously employed at [_LogRhythm_](https://logrhythm.com/) 💠

I have navigated fulfillment of FIPS 140-2 requirements for a project. I have broken monoliths into microservices. I have shoveled legacy code into tested & automated nightly builds and all of it again in <button dark-toggle aria-hidden>Night mode</button>. My tenure at LogRhythm taught me the importance of customer collaboration, automation of operations, and open technical perspectives. Those experiences taught me to recognize simple solutions and how to mentally begin to address chicken and egg problems.

I am currently employed at [_StackHawk_](https://stackhawk.com) 🦅

Helped build all parts of the company; from the UI and backend, to the documentation and underlying protos and build tools. Wrote terraform to provision replicated codebuild jobs across striped environments, expanded upon and helped structure the initial UI, slack, jira cloud & automated Api Documentation with OpenApi specs, readme and postman. Stripe integration. Began to harness the power of Kubectl and helm to provision to automate deployment of software to our clusters. Built and defined Argo Jobs to accomplish structured cron jobs and streaming data operations.

Lots of Documentation. Lots of functional programming. Build automation. Api Documentation automation. Separating CI from CD.

Developing software in adversarial conditions. Windows installer.

## 🤹 Technical Skills

I currently enjoy working with [_Typescript_](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [_Kotlin_](https://kotlinlang.org/). Previously I worked significantly with [_Go_](https://golang.org/) and [_Elixir_](https://elixir-lang.org/) . I also have familiarity and experience working in _Java_, _C_, _Python_ and _Ruby_ .

I like my frontends in react, angular, vue-js... just as long as its typescript. 
I like my backends in kotlin spring boot, or generated from openapi files. 
I like my notification services stateless. 
I like my operations managed with k8s and monitored with grafana. 

I prefer [_Terraform_](https://terraform.io) to provision replicated environments with IAC. 
I like [_Kubernetes_](https://kubernetes.io) to control, monitor and operate containerized software.

### Tools of the Trade

* [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) solid text/programming editor
* [intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) preferred editor for working in a jvm environment
* [better touch tool](https://folivora.ai/) for windowing n macros
* [lens](https://k8slens.dev/) visual UI for k8s, its pretty rad
* [docker](https://www.docker.com/) preferred container management solution
* [slack](https://slack.com/) preferred team communication mechanism
* [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/) preferred cloud provider
* [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) preferred front end integration test suite
* [zap](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/) open source DAST tool
* [grafana](https://grafana.com/) preferred open sopurce monitoring tool
* [stackhawk](https://www.stackhawk.com/) pretty awesome DAST and appsec monitoring tool
* [logrhythm](https://www.logrhythm.com/) pretty decent SIEM

### Philosophies

I am familiar with both the _Object Oriented Programming_ and _Functional Programming_
 software design philosophies. I have strong opinions about both of these, ask me about them.

 I also adhere loosely to the design philosophies of _Railway Oriented Programming_ and _Test Driven Development_.

I have worked with _gitflow_ and _trunk based_ software branching models. Both strategies have advantages and disadvantages.
  The key to fast and safe software development is to establish a _CICD_ pipeline, and aim to separate your _CI_ from your _CD_.

I enjoy working with the _Scrum_ and _Kanban_ iterative development philosophies, and advise talking to customers and soliciting constant feedback.
  
Engineers work with product and design to implement and structure software.
  Product works with engineering, marketing and customer support to direct the roadmap.
    Design team works with engineering and marketing teams to coordinate a brand and messaging.

Excellent communication and writing skills are just as necessary to Software Development as programming ability, if not more so.
  If the software has flaws, customers will go to your documentation. if your documentation sucks, customers will go to your competitors website.
