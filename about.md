## 💎 Samuel Volin
Programmer, Mathematician, Rad Dude & Your Friend

#### Hello! I am **Samuel Volin** aka _UNTRA_
<sam@untra.io> - [_keybase_](https://keybase.io/untra) - [_github_](https://github.com/untra) - [_twitter_](https://twitter.com/untra) - [_linkedin_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/untra/) - [_eth address_](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0570b8f2ee4dc8b710bf0c18269b3902857cfdca)

## 🏁 Mission Statement

Programming is more than a skill, it is a craft.

Good software is not conceived, it is developed over time, preferably by a team of dedicated and passionate friends, and with an eye towards overarching design and flexibility. Software engineering is about studying the trade-offs and nuances of the tools at your disposal, and becoming fearless in the face of the technical unknown. Through gradual practice and research, mastery is attainable.

## 🌄 Currently

I am a professional Software Developer, currently residing in **Boulder, Colorado**. I am passionate about mathematics, functional programming, software engineering, polyglot programming, network security, cryptography, and developer operations.

I am currently employed at [_LogRhythm_](https://logrhythm.com/)

I have navigated fulfillment of FIPS 140-2 requirements for a project. I have broken monoliths into microservices. I have shoveled legacy code into tested & automated nightly builds and all of it again in <button dark-toggle aria-hidden>Night mode</button>

## 🤹 Technical Skills

### Languages & Frameworks

I currently enjoy working with [_Typescript_](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [_Go_](https://golang.org/) and [_Elixir_](https://elixir-lang.org/) . I also have familiarity and experience working in _Java_, _C_ and _Ruby_ .

### Philosophies

I am familiar with both the _Object Oriented Programming_ and _Functional Programming_
 software design philosophies. I have strong opinions about both of these, ask me about them.

I enjoy working with the _Scrum_ and _Kanban_ iterative development philosophies. I have a few other opinions about these, but my convictions here aren't as strongly held.

> There is no one right way to build software.
